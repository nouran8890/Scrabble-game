###Welcome to Number Scrabble
It's a 2 player arithmetic game where we have a list of numbers from 1 to 9,
and the players alternate choosing numbers from the list with the condition that a chosen number can't be chosen again until one of them collects 3 numbers that add up to 15
and he will be the winner or the list is emptied with a tie.
